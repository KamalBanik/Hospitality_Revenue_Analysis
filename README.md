AtliQ Grands owns multiple five-star hotels across India. 
They have been in the hospitality industry for the past 20 years. 
Due to strategic moves from other competitors and ineffective decision-making in management, AtliQ Grands are losing its market share and revenue in the luxury/business hotels category. Now they are looking for insights from their past historical data that can help them regain their market share and revenue
